- Replace characters and penguins with capsules for ease of task
- 3d model for the main level can be downloaded here https://www.dropbox.com/s/8xg9k4mbz4ac5we/test-task.fbx?dl=0
- Make two main characters
     - The first one is controlled by the player using the arrows on the keyboard
     - The second is controlled by a computer. The second character is needed to test the logic of how the penguins run away.
- When the penguins leave the zone through the gate - they just disappear, for simplicity
- Try to replicate the movement dynamics of the penguins as accurately as possible from the video
